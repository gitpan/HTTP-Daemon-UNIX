NAME
    HTTP::Daemon::UNIX - HTTP::Daemon over Unix sockets

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.05 of HTTP::Daemon::UNIX (from Perl
    distribution HTTP-Daemon-UNIX), released on 2014-12-05.

SYNOPSIS
     use HTTP::Daemon::UNIX;

     # arguments will be passed to IO::Socket::UNIX, but Listen=>1 and
     # Type=>SOCK_STREAM will be added by default. also, HTTP::Daemon::UNIX will try
     # to delete stale socket first, for convenience.
     my $d = HTTP::Daemon::UNIX->new(Local => "/path/to/unix.sock");

     # will print something like: "http:path/to/unix.sock"
     print "Please contact me at: <URL:", $d->url, ">\n";

     # after that, use like you would use HTTP::Daemon
     while (my $c = $d->accept) {
         while (my $r = $c->get_request) {
             if ($r->method eq 'GET' and $r->uri->path eq "/xyzzy") {
                 # remember, this is *not* recommended practice :-)
                 $c->send_file_response("/etc/passwd");
             } else {
                 $c->send_error(RC_FORBIDDEN);
             }
         }
         $c->close;
         undef($c);
     }

     # client side code, using LWP::Protocol::http::SocketUnixAlt
     use LWP::Protocol::http::SocketUnixAlt;
     use LWP::UserAgent;
     use HTTP::Request::Common;

     my $ua = LWP::UserAgent->new;
     my $orig_imp = LWP::Protocol::implementor("http");
     LWP::Protocol::implementor(http => 'LWP::Protocol::http::SocketUnixAlt');
     my $resp = $ua->request(GET "http:path/to/unix.sock//uri/path");
     LWP::Protocol::implementor(http => $orig_imp);

DESCRIPTION
    This is a quick hack to enable HTTP::Daemon to serve requests over Unix
    sockets, by mixing in IO::Socket::UNIX and HTTP::Daemon as parents to
    HTTP::Daemon::UNIX and overriding IO::Socket::INET-related stuffs.

    Basic stuffs seem to be working, but this module has not been tested
    extensively, so beware that things might blow up in your face.
